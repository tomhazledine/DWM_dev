## Install instructions

Install Jekyll with `sudo gem install jekyll` (on a Mac).

*If you're re-installing after previously running `npm install`, remember to delete "node_modules/" directory before re-running.*

Run `gulp` to do work.

## Deployment notes

Remember to change `_config.yml` before deploying. `url` and `baseurl` are both different between live and local installations.
